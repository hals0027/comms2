                <p> Kaila Halsall-Page is an up-and-coming digital media creator best known for her athletics
                    photography. As a current student in the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College, she
                    strives to expand her knowledge beyond photography, developing her skills through multimedia
                    production. Driven by her passion for sports media, Kaila aspires to have a digital media career
                    with a major sports franchise in the future.</p>
                <p>After several years of doing solely photography, Kaila has chosen to broaden her potential business
                    horizons and has recently taken on graphic design, creating hockey graphics for her brother’s hockey
                    team. Using the knowledge of Photoshop that she had gained from her first semester at Algonquin, she
                    has been working hard to produce high-quality graphics.</p>
                <p>Through her teenage years, Kaila often found that the sports media industry was quite male-dominated;
                    because of this, she felt as though she was never truly respected by those around her. With the
                    current rise in female sports media, specifically the PWHL and its recent expansions, she hopes to
                    find a place among other strong and driven women. She aims to show other girls like her that there
                    is a place for them in the athletics community.</p>
