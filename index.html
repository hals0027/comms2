            <p> Damien Chazelle gets straight to the point with the opening scene: the two main characters, Andrew and
                Fletcher, and establishes their dynamics as very contrasting characters. Andrew is a hard-working,
                awkward, young adult, who dreams of being a jazz drummer, whereas his instructor, Fletcher, is a very
                harsh and brash man who believes that success can only be achieved by being “pushed beyond what's
                expected of them” and vaguely resembles a snapping turtle. I personally didn’t recognize any of the
                other actors, but I believe they were well chosen for their roles, since they weren’t overly relevant.
                The way they all interacted with each other was well done and very realistic. For example, when Andrew
                asked the girl on a date it was very awkward, with long pauses and just stale conversation. Also worth
                mentioning, the family dinner at the Neimans’ was a very realistic depiction of a family dinner; there
                was small talk about what was going on in everyones’ lives, which led to an argument about who would be
                going further in life.</p>
